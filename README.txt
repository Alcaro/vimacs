Vimacs (Vim-Improved eMACS) brings Emacs's extensive key bindings and modeless
editing features to the Vim world, while completely retaining Vim's powerful
moded editing style. 

Vimacs is based on the keymaps of GNU Emacs 21 and XEmacs, so if you are
familiar with them, you'll feel right at home in Vimacs.  For Emacs users,you
won't take long to get used to Emacs's keys: just like Vim, Emacs's key layout
has been designed so that commonly used keys are quick to access. 

Vimacs is a standard Vim plugin, so just put the vimacs.vim file in your plugin
directory, and put vimacs.txt in your documentation directory.  That's it!  If
you're using Unix, you should also read the INSTALL text file that comes with
Vimacs for notes on how to run Vim with or without Vimacs.
